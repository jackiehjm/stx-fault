Fault Management (FM)
=====================
The starlingx/fault repository handles Fault Management (FM) services [1]_, and
provides the fm command-line interface (CLI) [2]_.

This repository is not intended to be developed standalone, but rather as part
of the StarlingX Source System, which is defined by the StarlingX manifest [3]_.
